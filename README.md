# Steganography Reader: Bitmap â†’ Text


### Overview
This program takes a bitmap as input from the user, reads the R, G, and B values of each pixel, converts all values to hex, converts the hex to plaintext, and finally writes the output to a text file.


### Notes / Usage
* Make sure the input bitmap is placed in the directory called "bitmap" before running
* Conversions include space and newline characters
* The output text file gets saved to the project's root directory
* A few sample bitmaps have been included in the "bitmap" directory, but check out [StegaGenerator](https://github.com/kabirmadan/StegaGenerator) to generate your own
